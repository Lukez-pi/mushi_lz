\begin{abstract}

Models in evolutionary genetics typically assume that mutation rate is constant over time and between populations and closely related species.
However, recent work casts doubt on this assumption in human and ape populations, and reveals that mutation is a complex and dynamic process.
Whether arising from variation in replication fidelity, life history, or environmental exposures, mutation rate evolution can be accompanied by changes to the \emph{mutation spectrum}: the mutation rate in different local nucleotide contexts.
We extend theoretical tools based on Kingman's coalescent to accommodate a richly parameterized mutation process, varying in time and in spectrum.
% WD: revise below when we settle on what results will be in the paper
We infer human mutation spectrum histories from patterns of modern genomic diversity, allowing us to reconstruct trajectories of mutation spectrum divergence between populations, track a transient mutation spectrum perturbation through multiple populations, and characterize how mutation spectrum histories are structured by local nucleotide context.
Mutation rate and effective population size together determine the strength of genetic drift shaping genomic variation.
We introduce fast nonparametric joint inference of mutation spectrum history and demographic history from unphased genomes.

\section*{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

% WD: should this be less humany?
Population genetics has proved to be a powerful lens on human history\cite{Harris2017-cd}, revealing a complex past of migration\cite{?}, replacement\cite{?}, and admixture among human groups and extinct homonids\cite{?}, and dramatic population size changes during and after range expansions\cite{?}.
Germline mutation events in the history of a population give rise to variant alleles, and demographic histories are recorded in patterns of segregation within and between current-day populations.
Genetic drift is shared when populations mix, and it is private during periods of isolation.
The strength of drift is universally influenced by the population size history, thus population genetic methods for demographic inference---expressed in the framework of Kimura's diffusion or Kingman's coalescent---attempt to recover the effective population size history $N(t)$.

Mutation drives the evolution of populations and species, and mutation rate evolution has a storied history in the theoretical population genetics literature.
Haldane developed equilibrium theory for alleles in mutation-selection balance, and used this to provided the first principled estimate of the human mutation rate by studying hemophilia incidence\cite{Haldane2004-ov, Nachman2004-gh}.
Kimura  \cite{Kimura1967-ku}

Storied history of theoretical treatments:
- Kimura: \cite{Kimura1967-ku}
- drift barrier hyp of \cite{Lynch2016-ff}

The process of germline mutation is the writing mechanism that records signatures of demographic events in genomes, so its influence on modern genome variation is similar in importance to the demographic histories themselves.
Demographic inference methods can model complex population splits, migration, and admixture, in addition to modeling $N(t)$ as a piecewise constant (or exponential) function of time into the past.
Mutation, however, receives a relatively impoverished treatment: usually a single mutation rate parameter $\mu$ is understood to apply at all loci in all individuals at all times, and may be regarded as a nuisance parameter needed for time calibration of models whose natural dimensionless time is measured in generations.

Growing evidence indicates that germline mutation is a dynamic process on both interspecific and population time scales, and a complex function of polymorphic replication machinery, life history, mutagenic exposures, and genomic content.
Indeed, mutation rates among great apes have declined along the lineage leading to humans---a phenomenon termed the \emph{homonoid slowdown}\cite{Goodman1985-xc, Scally2012-rb}---, showing that mutation rate evolution between species distorts phylogenetic time calibration.
Children of older parents receive more germline mutations, especially so for older fathers, and this is thought to arise from replicative errors in spermatogenesis.
This \emph{parental age effect} \cite{} indicates that life history changes can influence the population mutation process.

Although methods exist for inferring locus-wise mutation rates \cite{Bhaskar2015-bd, Nelson2012-fr}, these require very large study sizes, and do not accommodate evolution of the rate or spectrum of the mutational process per se.

We have to be very clear about how what we’re offering is different than what can be done with Relate \cite{Speidel2019-ox}.
\begin{enumerate}
\item We can deal with unphased genomes.
\item Our method allows the total mutation rate to be variable whereas Relate fixes it to a constant, and does posthoc counting.
\item I do not quite understand how they count mutations in a given epoch, since they are not mapped to specific times, only to branches.
Unless mu(t) is constant, uniform sampling on the branch is not consistent
\item How does pulse timing compare?
\end{enumerate}

\cite{Harris2017-fw} showed triplet SNV spectrum differences between human groups and between great apes, and used a coalescent simulation approach to fit the timing of a pulse of \texttt{T\underline{C}C>T\underline{T}C} mutations in Europeans.
We develop coalescent theory for the dependence of the expected $k$-SFS on both demographic history (effective population size as a function of time into the past) \emph{and} mutation spectrum history (mutation intensities as a function of time into the past for each mutation type).
This is similar in spirit to Kelley's simulation-based approach (which assumed the European demography of \cite{Tennessen2012-dq}), but is much faster, more flexibly parameterized.

Some references for nonidentifiability of demographic history from the SFS: \cite{Baharian2018-np, Bhaskar2014-fu, Terhorst2015-xt, Myers2008-jp}.
It might be good to consider identifiability of mutation intensity history from the SFS conditioned on demographic history.

% Humblebrag: the word \emph{spectrum} is triply overloaded in this paper:

% \end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Non-identifiability of demographic history and total mutation rate}

As shown in appendix \ref{sec:appendix:forward:pcsws} eqn~\eqref{eqn:d2}, effective population size $\eta(t)$ and the total mutation rate $\mu(t)$ are non-identifiable at all times.
This is demonstrated by introducing a change of variables that measures time in expected number of coalescent events since the present.
This non-identifiability is similarly manifest by a change of variables to measure time in expected mutations \citetext{Peter Ralph, priv.\ comm.}.
This can be understood intuitively: an excess of variants of a given frequency can be explained by an historical bottleneck (which expands coalescent lines in the bottleneck time interval), but equally well by a period of increased total mutation rate with no demographic change.

\section*{Model}\label{sec:model}

The setting for our modeling is Kingman's coalescent \cite{Kingman1982-ge, Kingman1982-tf, Kingman1982-ys, Kingman2000-jr}, with all the usual niceties: neutrality, infinite sites, linkage equilibrium, and panmixia.
In Appendix \ref{sec:appendix} we detail our retracing of the derivation by \cite{Griffiths1998-qf} of the frequency distribution of a derived allele conditioned on the demographic history, while generalizing to a time inhomogeneous mutation process.
We make use of the results of \cite{Polanski2003-kg} and \cite{Polanski2003-ll} to facilitate computation, and build on the notation of \cite{Rosen2018-bb} for a finite-dimensional approximation of our demographic and mutation intensity histories.
Complete derivation of formulae are found in the Appendix.

Given $n$ sampled haplotypes and a demographic history $\eta(t)$ (with time measured retrospectively from the present), we show in Appendix \ref{sec:appendix:xi} that the expected SFS $\boldsymbol \xi = (\xi_1, \xi_2,\dots, \xi_{n-1})$ is a linear transform of the mutation intensity history $\mu(t)$:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eqn:transform}
\boldsymbol \xi = \mathcal{L}_{n,\eta(t)}\mu(t),
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{L}_{n,\eta(t)}$ is a finite-rank linear operator that maps infinite-dimensional mutation intensity histories to $(n-1)$-dimensional SFS vectors.
It is dependent on $n$ and $\eta$, which we take to be fixed.

% Need to talk about this fig \ref{fig:model}.

\begin{figure}

\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/model}
\caption{Schematic of the marked Poisson process model with $n=4$.
We condition on coalescent times $T_4=t_4,T_3=t_3,T_2=t_2$ and consider mutation intensity function $\mu(t)$.
Red dots indicate mutation events placed by time $t$, genomic position $x$, and coalescent line (which are depicted as extruded in the genomic coordinate axis, grey sheets).
The probability that a differential element $dxdt$ on a given sheet contains a mutation is proportional to the instantaneous mutation intensity $\mu(t)$.
}
\label{fig:model}
\end{figure}

In previous work \cite{Kelley, cancer, etc}, mutation spectra have been parameterized by grouping variants into mutation types according to local $k$-mer nucleotide context, and the number of variants called in each mutation type is taken as a proxy integrating an individual's ancestral mutational input in each type.
With $k$ odd and the variant registered in the central position there are $\kappa_k=2\times3\times4^{k-1}$ mutation types after collapsing by strand symmetry.
For example, there are $96$ triplet mutation types ($k=3$).
Here, we use the same $k$-mer mutation type parameterization to promote the $(n-1)$-element expected SFS vector $\xi$ to the $(n-1)\times\kappa_k$ expected $k$-SFS matrix $\Xi$.
Similarly, the mutation intensity history function $\mu(t)$ is promoted to the $\kappa_k$-element mutation spectrum history $\boldsymbol\mu(t)$, with each element giving the mutation intensity history function for one mutation type.
Equation \eqref{eqn:transform} becomes
\begin{equation}
  \label{eqn:transform_matrix}
\Xi = \mathcal{L}_{n,\eta(t)}\boldsymbol\mu^\intercal(t),
\end{equation}

For numerical implementation we consider finite-dimensional approximations of $\eta(t)$ and $\boldsymbol\mu(t)$ as piecewise constant functions of time on $m$ common epochs $[t_0, t_1), [t_1, t_2),\dots, [t_{m-1}, t_m)$ where $0=t_0 < t_1 < \dots < t_{m-1} < t_m=\infty$.
We take the epoch boundaries as fixed parameters, and in practice make them dense so as to approximate infinite-dimensional histories.
Let $\boldsymbol y = (y_1,\dots,y_m)$ denote the constant population size $\eta(t)$ during each epoch, and let the $m\times\kappa_k$ matrix $Z$ denote the constant mutation intensity during each epoch (rows) for each mutation type (columns).
In Appendix \ref{sec:appendix:pcsws} we show the linear transform \eqref{eqn:transform_matrix} reduces to the matrix equation
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:transform_discrete}
\Xi = L_{n, \boldsymbol y} Z,
\end{equation}
where the $(n-1)\times m$ matrix $L_{n, \boldsymbol y}$ is fixed given a fixed demographic history $\boldsymbol y$.

In linkage equilibrium the log likelihood function of the mutation spectrum history $Z$ given an observed $k$-SFS matrix $X$ and demographic history $\boldsymbol y$ is given by the Poisson random field approximation \cite{?}
\[
\ell(Z; X, \boldsymbol y, n) = \Tr(X^\intercal\log(L_{n, \boldsymbol y} Z)) - \|L_{n, \boldsymbol y} Z\|_1,
\]
where $\log(\cdot)$ operates elementwise, and we've dropped a constant term wrt $Z$.

% WD: more inverse problem intro
The inverse problem \eqref{eqn:transform_discrete} is ill-posed in general,
so many very different histories can be equally consistent with the data
\cite{oscillation paper? Yun's other papers?}.
We deal with this problem using regularization, to enforce well-behaved histories.
Our cost function to minimize, a penalized log-likelihood, is
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:penalized}
C(Z)
%\tilde\ell(\boldsymbol z)
= -\ell(Z) + R(Z) .
\end{equation}
The function $R(Z)$ incorporates our regularization.
In order to recover smooth histories,
we penalize the $L^p$ norms
of the time derivative of $\boldsymbol\mu(t)$
\[
\sum_{i=1}^{\kappa_k}\left\| \frac{d \mu_i(t)}{d t} \right\|_p^p
= \sum_{i=1}^{\kappa_k}\int_0^\infty\left|\frac{d\mu_i(t)}{dt}\right|^p dt,
\]
for $p=1,2$.
With piecewise constant histories as in \eqref{eqn:transform_discrete} this becomes
\[
\left\|\Delta Z \right\|_p^p.
\]
where $\Delta$ denotes the first difference matrix.
When $p = 1$, this is referred to as a fused LASSO or total variation (TV) penalty,
whereas $p=2$ is called a spline penalty.
We have implemented three different types of regularization.

The first option we call ``soft'' rank regularization, with
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:regularization_soft}
  R_\mathrm{soft}(Z)
  =
  \frac{  \lambda_\mathrm{spline} }{2} \left\|\Delta Z\right\|_2^2
  +
  \lambda_\mathrm{rank} \| Z \|_*
  +
   \frac{\lambda_\mathrm{ridge}}{2}  \| Z \|_\mathrm{F}^2
   .
\end{equation}
The spline term controls the smoothness of solutions,
and the rank term allows us to recover low-rank solutions.
The rank penalty is the nuclear norm $\| Z \|_*$,
which is equivalent to the $\ell^1$-norm on the singular values.
If $Z = U S V^\intercal$ is the SVD of $Z$, with $S = \mathrm{diag}(\sigma)$ then $\| Z \|_* = \| \sigma \|_1$.
The parameters $\lambda_\mathrm{spline}$ and $\lambda_\mathrm{rank}$ control the overall strength
of smoothing and rank regularization.
The function $R_\mathrm{soft}$ is convex; therefore we have a convex optimization problem
in this scenario.

The second option is ``hard'' rank regularization, where
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:regularization_soft}
  R_\mathrm{hard}(Z)
  =
  \frac{\lambda_\mathrm{spline}}{2} \left\|\Delta Z\right\|_2^2
  +
  \lambda_\mathrm{rank} \, \mathrm{rank}(Z)
  +
  \frac{\lambda_\mathrm{ridge}}{2} \| Z \|_\mathrm{F}^2
  .
\end{equation}
Here, the rank penalty is the actual rank of $Z$,
and note that $\mathrm{rank}(Z) = \| \sigma \|_0$.
In this case the problem is {\em not} convex.
However, we may still compute a proximal map for the non-differentiable rank term
and optimize with prox-gradients.

The third option allows more general smoothing but ignores all rank penalization:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:regularization_soft}
  R_\mathrm{indep}(Z)
  =
  \lambda_\mathrm{TV}
  \left\|\Delta Z\right\|_1
  +
  \frac{\lambda_\mathrm{spline}}{2} \left\|\Delta Z\right\|_2^2
  +
  \frac{\lambda_\mathrm{ridge}}{2} \| Z \|_\mathrm{F}^2
  .
\end{equation}
The TV terms control the smoothness of solutions,
and the rank term allows us to recover low-rank solutions.
The function $R_\mathrm{indep}$ is convex.
Note also that the columns of $Z$ are uncoupled,
so that we may solve this case as $\kappa_k$ different subproblems.

\subsection*{Tempora incognita: observability toward the coalescent horizon}\label{sec:model:loss}

Todo: SVD on $L_{n, \boldsymbol y}$

Intuitively, we know the SFS can't contain any information about the history beyond the TMRCA $T_2$, since mutations that occurred before then will not be segregating in the sample.
Thus, we will find it useful to penalize complexity in the history more heavily at times that are more probably ancestral to the TMRCA.

From \eqref{eqn:pi} and \eqref{eqn:r} in the Appendix \ref{sec:appendix}, the CDF of $T_2$ is
\begin{align}
F_2(t) &= 1 - \sum_{j=2}^n A_{2,j}r_2(t)\\
&= 1 - \sum_{j=2}^n A_{2,j}r_2(t)
